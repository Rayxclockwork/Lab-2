                <p>My name is Raven-Starr, but Raven is fine. I know, a bit of a mouthful, right?
                I am 27 years old and embarking on a new career path as a developer. I never attended a four-year institution
                and have had a series of odd jobs since graduating high school, but I'm hoping this puts me on a better path in life.
                I did attempt a two-year community college, but when that crashed I went to a cosmetology school in Lawrence, KS. 
                I did graduate and went on to recieve my cosmetology license. I tried out doing hair for a year but decided pretty quickly
                that wasn't going to be the right way to go for me. I've spent nearly my whole life in Kansas City with my family, and the last
                several years in my own apartment.
